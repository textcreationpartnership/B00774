            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First Part</hi> I undertooke, to cheere up the long-exerciſed expectations of ſuch well-affected <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as deſired in their dayes, to ſee ſome <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>conſolation,</hi> to the miſerably afflicted <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi> In that poore <hi>Booke,</hi> our <hi>Nation</hi> firſt read,
<pb facs="tcp:180870:3"/> 
               <hi>That God had begun to ſend a Deliverer vnto His people.</hi> This (me thoughts) <hi>in a time of my leaſure,</hi> was a worke not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beneath me: and that to bring <hi>Glad tidings,</hi> was next unto the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> To the going on with this <hi>Second Part,</hi> hath the united and repeated deſires, of well-diſpoſed people provoked me: I could not take ſo many <hi>expectations</hi> of my <hi>Betters,</hi> for leſſe then a <hi>Command;</hi> and that it was a <hi>Duty</hi> to ſatisfie them.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Booke</hi> hath many mens <hi>Stories:</hi> but I have laboured moſt upon the Kings. In penning of the <hi>whole,</hi> I had theſe two <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Truth</hi> and <hi>Plaineneſſe.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> (beſides the chargeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of procuring the <hi>Jntelligence,</hi> out of the Armies and elſe-where) hath coſt mee much more paines, then the bare writing: my care was, to learne out, and get acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch underſtanding Gentlemen, as had beene perſonally preſent in the <hi>Actions.</hi> To ſome of theſe, hath my <hi>Margent</hi> beene already thankefull: and here, eſpecially, am
<pb facs="tcp:180870:4"/> I againe, to that Gentleman of curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, whom you ſhall find named <hi>Page</hi> 46, in the <hi>Margent.</hi> I will not bee much diſpleaſed, if <hi>Gallobelgicus</hi> ſhall any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where differ from me: this by his former Bookes I perceive, that he hath made uſe of but few things, which I have not ſeene before his <hi>Mart:</hi> and my <hi>diligence</hi> (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) hath not beene behind his; and my <hi>Intelligence,</hi> I know to bee farre <hi>better. Truth</hi> is the pearle, I ſought for; which I have ſtill preferred before <hi>fauour:</hi> and had the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> well beaten the <hi>Swediſh</hi> now and then; I would not have omitted it. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ariety,</hi> is ſome <hi>ornament</hi> to a <hi>Booke:</hi> part of which mine now wants; as running al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the victories of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> If then any contrarily-affected ſhall give out, That I have omitted their victories: beſides this anſwer to them, That they ſhould have done well to have ſent me in their <hi>Intelligence:</hi> I further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, What victories theſe were, which ſuffered the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to march up
<pb facs="tcp:180870:4"/> and downe ſo many hundred miles in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> and that I never read, (in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the time of this Story) of any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize he undertooke, but he prevailed in it: his fortunes never receiving any remarkeable or conſiderable checke, but at <hi>Ingolſtat</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This truely I beleeve; That all their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed victories, which they have ſo often here given out, will hardly (yet) make up a <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Laurea Auſtriaca.</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I cannot but have: but they are <hi>caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and not <hi>affected</hi> ones; they are my <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances,</hi> not my <hi>purpoſes.</hi> And if thoſe that know better, (and be ſure they doe ſo) will adde to, or controll this; I ſhall thanke them for ſatisfying my <hi>Readers,</hi> in what I would have ſerv'd them; had I either known more <hi>Truth,</hi> or more <hi>Circumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for my <hi>ſecond Ambition, Plainneſse;</hi> that have I alſo laboured upon. I affected not to be too <hi>conciſe,</hi> or too <hi>ſententious.</hi> My care was, not to hunt for praiſe; by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of our noble Language, with fine new phraſes, and unhappily coyn'd words:
<pb facs="tcp:180870:5"/> the preſumptions of an over-bold <hi>fancy.</hi> Some <hi>military Termes,</hi> may perchance be <hi>obſcure,</hi> becauſe <hi>proper:</hi> which being their commendation, I would not (in this) deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto every capacity. In a many of theſe, may the Reader ſatisfie himſelfe, in my <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Diſcipline:</hi> and for underſtanding of the reſt, my Booke muſt waite the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its <hi>Readers</hi> induſtrie. To make all more <hi>Plaine,</hi> I have noted the <hi>places</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Action. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> cannot flie: therefore have I ſpecified the <hi>diſtances</hi> and <hi>lyings</hi> of the <hi>Townes;</hi> that you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>orderlineſſe</hi> and <hi>probabilityes</hi> of the Kings <hi>Proceedings:</hi> and that there was no <hi>impoſsibility</hi> in his Conqueſts. I have beene carefull, (if not too curious) in this point: and have taught thoſe <hi>Readers</hi> that have <hi>Mapps,</hi> how to turne them. This commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity becauſe all have not; and that in the ſame <hi>Mappe</hi> there be many townes of the ſame names; therefore have I beene ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in my <hi>Deſcriptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This one addition had I purpoſed to have
<pb facs="tcp:180870:5"/> made unto my <hi>Story:</hi> the <hi>Iournall,</hi> namely, or <hi>Diarye of the Actions of the Lower Saxony.</hi> And that, betweene the <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Generalls</hi> of the two adverſe <hi>Leagues,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and the <hi>Catholikes.</hi> That is to ſay; Betwixt the Lord <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar,</hi> the Lord <hi>Achatius Todt,</hi> Sir <hi>John Banier,</hi> and <hi>Bauditz:</hi> all Generalls for the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>League.</hi> Together with the two Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> and <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Bremen;</hi> all Generalls for themſelues, and the <hi>Proteſtant-League, reſpectively:</hi> on the one party. And, the Earles of <hi>Pappenhaim</hi> and <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> the Barons of <hi>Gronsfelt</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> with <hi>Reinacher, Boenickhauſen,</hi> and other Governours and Commanders: for the <hi>Imperiall</hi> party. But this have I beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave out, for want of conference with ſuch Gentlemen, as had perſonally beene em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the <hi>Actions:</hi> an inſtruction, which I much preferre, before all <hi>written Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:180870:6"/> My <hi>Preface,</hi> was onely to make the <hi>Readers</hi> underſtand my purpoſe; and I hope I have done it. The Readers muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberty of their ſeverall verdicts: and though they ſhould differ, yet muſt all paſſe for <hi>Iudgement.</hi> The pleaſing of them, muſt be put to the venture: but if I might not be thought partiall to mine owne; I would freely enough confeſſe, That having taken treble paines in <hi>This,</hi> more then in my <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> I had in <hi>This</hi> given my ſelfe ſo much the more ſatisfaction, then in the <hi>Former.</hi> With this comfort doe I now part with my <hi>Booke; That I have not yet entered upon a foyld Story.</hi> God turne the warres to a happy iſſue: I had much rather write of <hi>Peace,</hi> then <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi>

The hill is a maine rocke; whereof one ſide is craggy and barren, and the other covered with vines: the whole top of the little mountaine being crowned with the Caſtle, and with the ditches and out-works of it. Nor wanted here any inward fortifications; 800 or 1000. fighting men, being there in garriſon: and as for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,

The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellan</hi> or Governour, was one <hi>Keller;</hi> eſteemed till now a good brave fellow: and knowne generally by this brand, That he mortally hated all Proteſtants and their Religion. All toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, finally, made the place appeare ſo impregnable, that the Kings preparations to attempt upon it were rather ſcorned then feared, by the garriſon: who verily beleeved, that unleſſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> had <hi>wings,</hi> as well as <hi>Armes,</hi> they could never get up thither. Thoſe difficulties that ſerve for bridles to the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, become ſpurres unto the induſtrious: the more inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable therefore that the place ſeemed to be, the more deſirous was the King to overcome it.

The Governour (as 'tis ſaid) ſaved his owne life, by begging it at the Kings feete: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which favour, might perchance make him to love a Proteſtant the better, ever after. A Rit-maſter (or Captaine of a troope of Horſe) there was, that redeemed his owne life, with a Kings ranſome: by ſhewing, namely, an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſſe of treaſure, which lay hid in a Cave or cleft of the Rocke. The chiefe of the ſlaine and priſoners, were rifled and ſtripped by the conquerors: and the Caſtle for one houre, permitted to the pillage: where an unvaluable booty was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the ſouldiers.

But whereas he now perceived, that notwithſtanding it had in the late <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, how the warre made againſt him in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperor, was without the knowledge, and againſt the will of the Princes and Electors; yea quite againſt the lawes and priviledges of the Empire: yet did the <hi>Catholike Leaguers</hi> for all this, ſtill goe on in their pernicious Combinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; yea even after they had by their owne letters,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180870:16"/> (oftner then once) avowed themſelues to become his firme friends; and that he thereupon had paſſed his promiſe vnto the <hi>French</hi> King, that would they but ſit downe as <hi>Neuters,</hi> he would offer no iniury at all vnto them. And whereas he had purſued the victory of <hi>Leipſich</hi> with no other purpoſe, then of bringing the diſturbers of the peace vnto equall tearms and Conditions; and had before the bringing of his army into <hi>Franconia,</hi> both fairely and timely ſignified that his purpoſe vnto the two Biſhops of <hi>Bamberg</hi> and <hi>Wurtsburg;</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a friendly treatment from them againe.

Wherefore, his Maieſties expreſſe pleaſure at this time was, That all Officers and Burgers ſhould, upon the firſt notice given them of this <hi>Mandate</hi> of his, repaire vnto the place appointed them in it, take oath there, unto that his form of government, and dutifully hereafter to obey it. Vpon hope, therefore, that ſo they would doe, he would graciouſly from hence forward take them into his protection, permit

            <p>His Maieſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> is all this moneth of October in <hi>Wurtsburg</hi> for the moſt part, though at <hi>Carlſtat</hi> now and then with the new Army. You may perceive that he ſent to take in the townes upon the <hi>Mayn;</hi> both thoſe that lye upon it Eaſtward towards <hi>Norimberg,</hi> and thoſe Weſtward too, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Franckford.</hi> Both theſe great Cities were Paſſes of mighty importance: and the <hi>Catholike Leaguers</hi> had lands both wayes: the <hi>Temporall</hi> Princes lay moſtly towards <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg,</hi> and the three Spirituall Electors lay all beyond <hi>Franckford.</hi> So that much deliberation had the King with himſelfe,<note place="margin">The King in doubt whither to goe next.</note> to which of theſe two places he ſhould firſt turne his Armies: both being (upon the point) now equally almoſt diſtant from him. The importance of theſe two Paſſes very well appeares by <hi>Tilly</hi> alſo: who when he ſuppoſed the King likely to goe towards <hi>Norimberg,</hi> then turnes he downe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hanaw</hi> and <hi>Franckford,</hi> and ſollicites them to take in his garriſons: but when againe he perceived the King making
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180870:18"/> towards <hi>Franckford,</hi> then goes he with all ſpeed and blocks up <hi>Norimberg.</hi> But God now became the Kings Counſellor; He preſently helpt him out of this doubt. The <hi>Norimbergers</hi> having beene ſollicited by the King, now ſend their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to accord with him: ſo that to <hi>Norimberg</hi> now, he need not goe. But how ſhould he get to <hi>Franckford?</hi> The mighty ſtrong City of <hi>Hanaw</hi> lay full in his way, and was the paſſe to <hi>Franckford:</hi> yea and <hi>Tilly</hi> with his whole Army lay now alſo about <hi>Hanaw.</hi> There is no leauing of an enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind ones backe: ſo that though <hi>Tilly</hi> were out of the way, yet muſt <hi>Hanaw</hi> firſt be had, or elſe no comming at <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> And to increaſe the difficulty of getting of <hi>Hanaw</hi> time enough to ſerve his turne; was the great ſtrength of the place firſt: upon which had the City formerly beene ſo confident, that having had ſome differences with the Emperor, it would never (as the proverb is) give him a good word; yea when ſome 3 yeeres ſince one of his Leiftenants had blockt it up, he was faine after 17 weekes to riſe and goe without it. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond difficulty was, that the enemy had a party already with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City: 6 companies of Imperiall ſouldiers (ſome 1200 in all) and <hi>Brandeis</hi> that commanded them in chiefe, had even already laid the plot with <hi>Tilly,</hi> for the ſudden ſurpriſing of it. The Kings haſte and manner of warfaring, is not to lye long at a ſiege: <hi>Hanaw,</hi> therefore, which it was thus difficult to conquer by ſtrength, was by private friendſhip all on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den made his; and the ſlow enemy (now ſtanding betwixt wooing and forcing it,) had his noſe wypt of it. The Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> firſt of all preſſes the City to take in more forces of the Emperors: and <hi>Tilly</hi> is earneſt to haue 4. Companies (into which he would have put 1000 men) taken into the towne. This being denied, threatnings are added: and becauſe the way of force would of it ſelfe be too tedious; and in the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> neereneſſe, no leſſe dangerous: <hi>Brandeis</hi> the Captaine is practiſed withall, to let <hi>Tilly</hi> by night into the City. <hi>Philip Lodowick,</hi> Earle of <hi>Hanaw</hi> (a Proteſtant) being not ignorant of all this; and even now alſo angred with <hi>Tilly</hi>

               </note>Vpon Munday the laſt of October, is <hi>Chriſtopher Haubald</hi> one of the Kings Colonels, (a wiſe and valiant Gentleman) employed upon the <hi>Anſlaught.</hi> His forces were ſome 600 choſen horſemen and dragooners, and no more; whatſoever <hi>Gallobelgicus</hi> writes. With theſe, he in one day and nights continuall flying march, haſtens from <hi>Carlſtat</hi> vnto <hi>Hanaw;</hi> the 2 townes being full 12 common <hi>Germane</hi> leagues diſtant; each league, here and throughout the ſtory, meant to be foure <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles: with theſe was he by foure or five a clocke upon Tueſday morning, November 1. 1631. gotten to the gates of <hi>Hanaw,</hi> or ever his enemies dreamt of it. His way to come at the towne, was thorow the wood that is beyond the <hi>Kintz:</hi> in which wood hewing downe poaſts; he by pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on either ſide the narrow river, and by faſtning two
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180870:21"/> roapes to them, and laying boords and rafters over theſe roapes; both ſilently and ſuddenly paſſed over the water. Comming to the Caſtle gate next unto the <hi>Kintz,</hi> he hath that by the Earles direction (upon the watchword given) immediately opened vnto him, by which he enters into the <hi>Old</hi> Towne. The firſt worke he did, was to clap to the gate that led out of the <hi>Old</hi> towne into the <hi>New;</hi> by which meanes thoſe of the <hi>New</hi> towne were barred out, from ayding their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the <hi>Old</hi> City. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> foote getting up preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the top of the wals or Bulwarks, runne immediately two ſeverall wayes at once, to make themſelues maſters of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two gates on either hand of the Caſtle gate: thoſe three, being all the ports that belong to the <hi>Old</hi> Towne. The horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the ſame time poſſeſſing themſelues of the market place, hinder thereby the townſmen from gathering to a head: by which meanes was the whole towne (both within and without) in a trice aſſured vnto them. The two Companies of Imperiall ſouldiers, being thus taken ſleepers, could not ſo ſoone get themſelues armed: and ſome of the Burgers (that had not beene made acquainted with the plot) now taking the Alarme and offering to reſiſt, have ſome 8 of their company ſlaughtered. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> upon the walles, runne every way up and downe, ſhooting at randome in the darke; to fright thereby whoſoever ſhould adventure to come neere them. The Earle of <hi>Hanaw</hi> alſo, (whoſe Counteſſe lay in at the ſame time) is preſently taken priſoner, and a guard ſet upon his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and perſon. This was done in a ſeeming good earneſt, to put off all ſuſpition of a plot, from him.</p>
            <p>By that time it was towards day-light, were the 4 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in the <hi>New</hi> towne up in armes alſo, though they all this while had attempted nothing for the reskue of the <hi>Old</hi> City. Said it was, that <hi>Brandeis</hi> went merry to bed the night before; and that when being awakt by five in the morning, he was by one of the Burgers told of the <hi>Swedes</hi> being in the <hi>Old</hi> Towne; he was ſo farre from beleeving it, as he forbade the Alarme to be ſounded. And when one of his own Officers a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180870:22"/> little after that, told him the ſame tale; They are not the <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſaith he, they be our own friends of <hi>Aſchaffenburg,</hi> for whom I wrote yeſterday: not ſuffering the Alarme to be ſtrucke up yet. But when he by breake of day perceived his error; The <hi>Swedes</hi> be divels (quoth he,) how was it poſſible for them ſo ſoone to get in hither? Starting up preſently thereupon, and all vnbuttoned as he was, out comes he into the ſtreet; running for life up and downe; and even till he ſwet againe in that froſty morning, to ſet on his men. Two thouſand armed men (what with ſouldiers, Boores and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) had he by day-light gotten together: which <hi>Haubald</hi> now perceiving, drawes his <hi>Swedes</hi> along upon the wall that lookes into the New towne; whence both with Piſtols and Carbines, he lets flye amongſt them: by which, two men and one woman were ſlaine out-right, and ſome others wounded. By this time had the <hi>Swedes</hi> brought a ſmall peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the place; which they alſo bending upon the <hi>New</hi> Towne, demanded them to yeeld immediately. The Citizens anſwered reſolutely, That they would not yeeld up the towne, till they had their Princes conſent firſt. <hi>Haubald</hi> at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, telling them that he was their Earle. They demaund it againe, telling him that till then, they had nothing but bullets for him. The Earle hereupon being brought with a guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, upon the wall; tells them, That he being now a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, could give them no better counſell, then to yeeld upon as good termes as they could get. This mov'd not Captaine <hi>Brandeis</hi> any thing: but firſt would he have had the Burgers to have gone on againſt the <hi>Swedes:</hi> which they bidding him doe himſelfe firſt, he durſt not. Then would he have had the Ordnance brought downe thither from the walls, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the <hi>Swedes:</hi> but neither would the <hi>Burgers</hi> ſuffer that, for feare of ſpoyling their friends and friends houſes in the <hi>Old</hi> Towne. Then would he have ſent one of his own ſervants over the towne ditch, to have runne to <hi>Steinheim:</hi> whereabouts Colonel <hi>Eynot</hi> had ſome good forces: but this is alſo croſſed by the Citizens; for that it would have brought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180870:22"/> 
               <hi>Tillyes</hi> whole Army upon them; which lying hard by it at that time, might have endangered the plundering of the whole City. A iuſt feare: ſeeing <hi>Tilly</hi> might very lawfully have done it; as having reskued the City from his enemy. <hi>Haubald</hi> once againe demanding up the towne, and that preſently; is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the Magiſtrates could not ſo ſoone come together to conſult upon it. He grants them halfe an houre, thereupon: meane while his men gave over ſhooting.

            <p>Captaine <hi>Brandeis</hi> ſeeing now no remedy, deſires for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and for his men, that they might have ſouldiers conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and goe out with full Armes, &amp;c. No (ſaies <hi>Haubald</hi>) your ſelfe with all your Officers and ſouldiers in the towne, ſhall immediately repaire unto the gallowes before the gate betweene the two townes, trayle your Armes and Enſignes thither, lay them downe there, and abſolutely ſubmit your ſelues unto my pleaſure; either for life or death, favour, or not favour That which cannot be reſiſted, ſhould not be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: they lay downe Armes, and <hi>Haubald</hi> in courteſie returnes them their ſwords againe. Thus their Colours being gone, their military oath unto the Emperor was by this meanes void; which <hi>Haubald</hi> taking advantage of, invites them into his pay: of which all ſave thirty or forty (that were more <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> then the reſt) preſently accepted. <hi>Brandeis</hi> the Captaine refuſing, is made priſoner: and ſo is <hi>Merci,</hi> Sergeant-Major unto <hi>Piccolomini;</hi> two Ritt-maſters, with divers of <hi>Tillyes</hi> Commanders more; who had retired into that Towne to be healed of their wounds received at the battell of <hi>Leipſich.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:180870:23"/> was kept in his own houſe, vnder a guard of ſome 5 or 6. ſouldiers: the reſt had the liberty of the towne, but not to goe without the Ports.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haubald</hi> having thus maſtered the Towne by his valour; provides to keepe it by his wiſedome. Firſt ſends he two Companies into the Caſtle: then takes he order for ſome new Fortifications; of which, himſelfe being a skilfull Enginier, drawes the Platforme. Next layes he out to have 5 or 6 new Companies raiſed; which were made up of thoſe that had lately yeelded, and ſome others gotten out of the Country: Caſting about in the laſt place, how to have all theſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For this laſt purpoſe, no ſooner was <hi>Tilly</hi> gone out of the Countrey (which he did preſently after he ſaw himſelfe defeated of his hopes, both of this towne and <hi>Franckford</hi>) but that <hi>Haubald</hi> diſpeedes about his letters (in a ſtile imperious enough) vnto his amazed neighbours of the land of <hi>Darmſtat,</hi> and the <hi>Wetteraw;</hi> as alſo to the Townes of <hi>Steinheim, Seling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat, Dieburg, Hoeſt, Konigſtein, Orb, Hauſen</hi> and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing partly unto the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and partly unto other Lords: That without denyall or delay, they bring unto him into <hi>Hanaw,</hi> all the Contribution money, corne, hay, and oates, which they had before paid unto the <hi>Catholike Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers;</hi> and that they never hereafter either pay or aide, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the King his Maſter.

            <p>The Treaty begins with a Preface, unto this purpoſe. That ſeeing the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had never deſerved of the Empire or Emperor to be provoked to this warre; which the King was forced to enter into for his owne defence, the Electors themſelues having heretofore acknowledged ſo much for him: and that theſe Earles alſo, as members of the Empire, having ever beene regardfull of their duties unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror their Head; never having either done or intended hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, any act in preiudice of him: yet nevertheleſſe the ſaid Emperor having, without ever denouncing of warre, ſeverall wayes aſſaulted Vs the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> oppreſſed our Couſins and Allies; vndone many Princes of ancient families (giving their lands and honors away vnto <hi>new</hi> men;) violated all the priviledges of the Empire; purpoſed to introduce an abſolute government into <hi>Germany</hi> firſt; and by help of that, the eaſily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enthrall the neighbour Princes afterwards: even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith the King) have We by way of prevention, and for our owne ſecurity, beene enforced to come thus armed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Empire. Whereas, moreover, the Princes of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike League,</hi> have againſt our expectation and deſert; both before the battell of <hi>Leipſich,</hi> and afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the honour of God, therefore, the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the reſtoring of the courſe of Iuſtice; and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Country; have We, upon good and mature conſideration, accepted of his Royall prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Whereas theſe Earles have this long time ſtood diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the moſt part of their eſtates, by the Catholike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; We promiſe our aſſiſtance to the recovery of them: both in regard of their Religion, and of the many ſervices they have

            <p>3. If during theſe warres, the enemy ſhould deprive any of theſe Earles, or otherwiſe ruinate their dominions; We ſhall right him the beſt We may, and force their enemies to reſtitution.</p>
            <p>4. If any of them ſhall be taken priſoners; We ſhall doe our beſt for the recovery of his liberty.</p>

And we doe hereby bind our ſelues, bodies and goods: to ſtand for him to the uttermoſt of our power; never to fall off from him; to doe nothing in preiudice of him; never to have treaty, or to make peace with his Maieſties enemies, (whom we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for our own:) but by his Royall aſſent, and except his Crowne bee therein comprehended, and himſelfe fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore doe we henceforth promiſe, to hinder by all our beſt endevours, his hurt; and to promote his good: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by counſell nor by action, directly nor indirectly, doing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180870:29"/> any thing againſt his perſon, Crowne or Dignity; but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to aſſiſt him rather.</p>
            <p>3. And whereas nothing is more requiſite, then that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty have the abſolute command of the warres: we therefore as his other Confederates have done, moſt humbly entreat him to take that care wholly upon him; which we without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction will altogether leave unto him.</p>
            <p>4. Therefore have we delivered up into his Maieſties hands, all our Cities, Forts, and Paſſages: and I the Earle of <hi>Hanaw,</hi> have freely put my City and Caſtle of <hi>Hanaw</hi> into his power; to fortifie, arme, and diſpoſe the ſame, as the reaſon of the warres ſhall require.</p>
            <p>5. We doe further promiſe, not to open our holds or paſſages unto the enemy; nor to receive in any of theirs; but keep them out rather unto the uttermoſt: opening them on the other ſide unto his Maieſty, to lodge or enquarter his troopes in.</p>
            <p>6. Wee will alſo ſuffer his Rendezvous in our Countries: provided, that the charges bee defalked out of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.</p>

            <p>8. We undertake alſo, if neede be, to arme our ſubiects for his Maieſties ſervice: to call home thoſe that at this time ſerve the enemy; confiſcating all their goods that refuſe to obey us.</p>

Theſe inconveniences, doe wiſe men ſuffer themſelues to be ſometimes put unto by their Friends; even after they have warned thoſe Friends, of their foreſight of theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.

The firſt view the King tooke of the Towne, was upon the loweſt ſide; and where he had thought to have begun: but that he found ſo well fortified with Outworkes, Seconds, and Retreats, one worke within another, that he call'd them the <hi>Divels workes.</hi> He quickly diſcovered, that there was no attempting that way: yea judged by the beſt ſouldiours it was, that it could not have beene a buſineſſe of leſſe then a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or three weekes time, to have maſtered all theſe works, and ſo to have come at the Towne. Altering his courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and deviding his little Army into two parts, hee by faire day light brings them on by another ſide, and lodges them within Musket ſhot, or 150 paſes of the very walles: yea Lieftenant Colonell <hi>George Douglaſſe</hi> (a brave ſouldiour then newly come up to the King) having firſt runne his lines, ſets himſelfe downe with ſome three hundred men, (the moſt of them being the ſame <hi>Scottiſh</hi> that had <hi>ſtormed Oppenheim</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) even in the very Port.

            <p>On Sunday, the King tooke a full view of the Caſtle on the lands ſide; which he found to be regularly and modernly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and ſo well flancked with ſmall workes one within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that hee called it the <hi>Divels head.</hi> His Majeſtie now finding, both Towne and Caſtle likely enough to diſpute the matter with him; immediatly ſends to <hi>Mentz</hi> for more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:

            <p>The towne thus wonne, the enemy from the Caſtle on the hill (which hung over the towne) ſhot amaine into the ſtreets,<note place="margin">This was not Lieftenant Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe.</hi>

The Caſtle hill is very ſteepe; and ſo neere unto the Towne, that the foot of it even touches the very houſes: nor is there any wall betweene. The Caſtle it ſelfe was of no ſtrength; it was the ſituation onely, and the continued works, (from the very top unto the bottom almoſt) which made it ſo ſtrong a place. The Second view of it, was at a diſtance taken by the King the ſame Munday night; when himſelfe going prying up and downe at the foot of it, was the formoſt man; his great Commanders comming all hard behind him.

The Kings ſight being naturally none of the ſharpeſt at a diſtance, hee looking behind him, ſpyes a Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (whom hee very well knew) to whom hee immediately calles by his name; Come hither Thou, ſuch a one; thou ſhalt have 100 Dollars to goe up and ſee what the enemy doth in the next <hi>Traverſe,</hi> and to bring mee a perfect view of what thou there diſcovereſt. The Sergeant did ſo, came downe ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had his money. Being downe, the King laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe along the ſloape of the hill; upon his backe almoſt, (that is, more upon his backe then upon his ſide) commands the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant to come and lye upon him, and to ſhew him what hee had diſcovered. The Sergeant did ſo: laid himſelfe ſo upon the King, that his backe lying upon the Kings boſome and breſt, and his further arme over the Kings ſhoulder, (both their faces being towards the enemy) hee there points with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:180870:50"/> his other hand towards the <hi>Traverſe,</hi> to deſcribe the enemies poſture unto the King. But the Kings Iudgement (which is a Curious one) being not yet ſatisfied; he commands off the Sergeant, and clambers up himſelfe to the very corner of that <hi>Traverſe:</hi> where having ſatisfied himſelfe, he at his comming downe ſpeakes it aloud unto his army, Now will I have this Caſtle by to morrow five a clocke.</p>

The hill being ſtony in many places, the ſouldiers were faine to breake it with pickaxes; and to climbe up that ſteepy place with great difficultie, ſcarce able to hold their feet many times. At the end of this firſt line, was there (the next morning) another line runne, even unto the point of a great <hi>Ravelin</hi> of the enemies. In this Trench, my Lord Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> (out of his deſire to ſatisfie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe) beeing ſomething farre advanc't alone by himſelfe; was friendly adviſed by the King not to be ſo haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, nor to adventure his perſon ſingly, ſo neere unto the enemies.</p>
            <p>The lines being by Tueſday night perfected, a myne was preſently digged; directly under the <hi>Ravelin</hi> aforeſaid. This being the next day finiſhed, the King cauſed about three a clocke in the afternoone to be ſprung.

And yet all conſidered, it wrought well enough: ſeeing it blew open the point of the ſaid <hi>Ravelin,</hi> huffing up many of the Defendants into the ayre, and leaving the reſt more naked and open within the worke. Hereupon was the aſſault given, in this following manner:</p>

And whereas other ſoldiours would roundly have come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning off; theſe onely turned aſide a little under the enemies <hi>Ravelin,</hi> where they ſtood ſafely enough. In this firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was Lieftenant-Colonell <hi>Talbot</hi> ſhot in the Shoulder: who being rowled downe the Hill, was fetcht off by Maſter <hi>Marſham,</hi> and led into the Towne. The King, (then at the Foote of the Hill) perceiving his men to be beaten off; call them <hi>Pultrons,</hi> and all to be-cowardied them: preſently commanding the skaling-ladders to be in another place,<note place="margin">fall on againe.</note> ſet unto the Rampier of the <hi>Ravelin.</hi> And heere his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken notice of the valour of my Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and encouraging manner claps him upon the Shoulder, bidding him to goe on againe.

The King hereupon calls off his men from the aſſault, and ſent a guard preſently into the Caſtle. The next morning being Wedneſday, Ianu. 22. the King entred the place; giving the enemyes leave to depart with their Armes and baggage, but not with their Colours: adding again this further condition, That they ſhould not ſerve againſt him in ſixe moneths, on this ſide the <hi>Moſel:</hi> marry if they found him on the other ſide, let them doe their worſt and ſpare not.

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Archbiſhop and Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> &amp;c. brother to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and a prime member of the <hi>Catholike League;</hi> is a Prince of great meanes, and of very large Iuriſdiction. He was the man that ſet out <hi>Pappenheim:</hi> to whom when the <hi>Catholike Leaguers</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:180870:53"/> had given a Commiſſion for a flying Army, the Elector of <hi>Cullen</hi> furniſht him both with men and money, in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. He, whileſt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> tempeſt was yet farre off from him in <hi>Franconia;</hi> wiſely begins to thinke how to keep it off, ſhould the wind once blow it that way. In a bodily feare of his Biſhoprick he was, and could have wiſht that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had not proceeded ſo roundly againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſo farre provoked the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to repay the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes</hi> in their own coyne againe for it: <hi>Was there ever ſuch an Imperiall Decree</hi> (ſaies <hi>Cullen) to cauſe all Cloyſters to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for which we are now loſing whole Biſhopricks?</hi> About the end of October, therefore, 1631. he agrees with the States of <hi>Cullen</hi> for the ſummoning of a <hi>Diet,</hi> to conſult together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meanes of defence: to whom his Electorall Highneſſe made this following propoſition. That ſeeing the Empire was now brought into ſuch a ſtrait; there was no remedy fairely to relieve it, but for the State to agree upon a good round Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie. They conſent to levie 200000 Dollars: with Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the monies ſhould be expended no otherwaies, then for the neceſſary defence of the Biſhoprick;<note place="margin">Diet <hi>at</hi> Cullen</note> and for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſouldiers, which they then agreed to have raiſed, over which one of the Counts of <hi>Iſenberg</hi> was to be Generall. The money, by three even portions to be levied upon the Gentry, the Cloiſters, and the ſeverall Cities of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> working downe lower towards them, this Subſidie now proved too little: whereupon in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 14 following, the Elector ſets out a Briefe for the drawing of a voluntary Contribution out of the richer ſort: That for Gods ſake, his Mother, and Saints cauſe; they would give what they could ſpare, towards the upholding of the <hi>Roman</hi> religion: promiſing that the money ſo given, ſhould be to no other purpoſe employed: but be put into a cheſt with 2 locks in the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> Church: of which the <hi>Prior</hi> to have one key, and his Highneſſe <hi>Steward</hi> the other. The Briefe he commands to be firſt read in every Church, and then the Copy to be ſet upon the Church doores.</p>

            <p>The ſame day Sennight did the Towne of <hi>Cullen</hi> ſet out another Briefe ſomething contradictory to the former; for they would have a Cheſt placed in the <hi>Chamber</hi> of their <hi>City,</hi> to put the Benevolence into: which was to be expended for the ſafety of the City alone.</p>

            <p>1. The firſt reaſon was this.<note place="margin">His Reaſon</note> That ſeeing <hi>Tilly</hi> would not be fought withall ſingle; he thought it no policy to drive him up to <hi>Wallenstein:</hi> which two if they ſhould have joyned with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and then all three have turnd againe upon him; they might poſſibly have beene too hard for him: eſpecially in that place, which they knew and not he.</p>
            <p>2. By this meanes, he ſhould for the time, have laid the ſeate of the warre in his friends the Prince <hi>Palatines</hi> dominions: which would utterly have ruin'd them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Bavaria</hi> being ſtill entier and untoucht, ſupplyed his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both with men and money: whereas were but the field of warre removed thither; himſelfe ſhould get his ſhare of that, and cut ſo much of it off from the enemy: yea and the enemyes part of it too muſt of neceſſity be deſtroyed, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Tilly</hi> to defend it.</p>
            <p>4. This would utterly defeate the Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi> project,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180870:77"/> (which the King by intercepted letters came to underſtand) that he would not have <hi>Tilly</hi> for this reaſon come into <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> and that he had deſired of the Emperour, that no army might be ſent into, or thorow his Country.</p>
            <p>5. It would kill the very hearts of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> to ſee an enemy in their owne Country. For tis commonly ſeene, that people who are valorous enough abroad, and to keepe out the warre; are danted and amazed to ſee it brought home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The firing of the beacons (where any are) or the rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Bells awck, (where that is uſed) will hardly draw them together to make head: and their hearts are quite done, notwithſtanding all encouragements of fighting <hi>pro Aris et focis:</hi> for the people will give one halfe, to ſave the tother; the Cityes will yeeld; and the enemy in a ſhort time, will be as ſtrong as the Prince himſelfe, in his owne Country.</p>
            <p>6. Should hee not now haſten into <hi>Bavaria;</hi> hee could not have gotten in thither at all; or at leaſt-wiſe neither ſo ſoone, nor ſo neere a way. There was a Fort now a building at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawert;</hi> which ſhould he ſtay till it were finiſhed, hee muſt then goe by <hi>

Some of theſe Muskettiers are brought within Musket ſhot of the very walles; who with their continued volleyes were to amuſe the enemy, untill the King had round about taken his full view, of the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Caſtle.

The hill reached from the very walles of the Towne, unto the <hi>Danuby:</hi> the Fort it ſelfe being betwixt the towne and river; and within Musket ſhot of either. It was not as yet able to doe the Kings folke any annoyance; it had no batteries finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: by it therefore did the King thinke fitteſt to approach. On the bottom of the hill, cloſe to the rivers ſide, was there a handſome Suburb, and thorow it, a Port into the Towne. In this Suburb, the King about nine a clocke in the morning, March 26, firſt of all cauſes 500 good Muskettiers to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. His next worke was, on the ſame ſide of the hill, to raiſe up a Battery, and to mount twenty Peeces of Ordnance upon it: from whence he ſo flanckered the bridge, both with his Cannon and 500 Muskettiers; that the ſame men were able both to annoy the Towne, and to diſturbe all paſſage over the ſaid bridge, inward and outward.

Thoſe within the Towne, now perceiving (to their terror) that they were neither able to reſiſt the King, nor to ſtay the expectation of reliefe; thought a little before breake of day, to have under favour of the darkeneſſe marcht out of the Towne over the bridge, into that part of <hi>Schwabenland</hi> towards <hi>Bavaria.</hi> This deſigne of theirs, was hindered by Colonell <hi>Hebron;</hi> who now flanckering the bridge much neerer then the King on his ſide did, gave them ſuch uneaſie paſſage: that though <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg</hi> and ſome few with him got ſafely over, yet the reſt that would have followed, were by thoſe volleyes ſo cut downe; that their dead bodyes even covered the moſt part of the bridge; and foulely encumbred the whole paſſage of it. The reſt yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſeeing their retreate that way to be cut off; made a ſalley out at the Weſt Port, upon <hi>Hebron:</hi> and were to their loſſe repulſed.</p>
            <p>The King thundered all this while upon the other Port with his Cannon; and they within, ſtill fearing his entrance that way; were reſolved once againe to venture the forcing of their paſſage thorow <hi>Hebron;</hi> who they knew to be the weaker.

The place appointed for the working of the bridge, was at <hi>Oberendorff;</hi> a ſmall Dorp ſome halfe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from the very point, where the King intended to lay it over. The place reſolved upon, was betwixt <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>Thierhanbten;</hi> juſt upon a point of land: made ſo, by the crooking or bending of the River. The ground on the Kings ſide, was a pikes length higher banckt, and playner withall, then that on <hi>Tillyes:</hi> which was both lower, and wooddy. There was a tryall made firſt of all, to lay a floate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; but the River would not endure that: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be not above thirty or forty paces over at the moſt, yet by reaſon of the ſtraight courſe of it, the ſtreame ſets very ſwift and violent.</p>
            <p>All the materials being now prepared; the King about nine at night, upon the fourth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> advances ſome 1000 <hi>Commanded men,</hi> unto the place aforeſaid.

Whileſt the Pioners are thus a working, the King in divers other places (both above it and below) gives falſe fires and Alarms, both with Muskets and ſmaller fielding peeces, for to amuſe the enemy; that till the morning they could not imagine where to find him.</p>

The <hi>Fins</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> laboured upon the worke, and made good the place; till that about 4 a clock in the afternoone, both it was finiſhed, and they relieved.</p>
            <p>The King all this while, is diligent in laying over his bridge, and <hi>Tilly</hi> as buſie to raiſe up Batteryes to beate it downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

For notwithſtanding <hi>Tilly</hi> had (with as much judgement and advantage as poſſibly might be) raiſed his Batteryes, not cloaſe unto the Rivers ſide, but at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the banke: yet were all his ſhot ſo kept off by the round and ſudden ſhouldering away of the banke of the River at either end, that his Ordnance could not poſſibly come to beare upon the bridge; but that either the bullets fell ſhort and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:180870:83"/> were latcht by the little <hi>Half-moone,</hi> or hill upon the high banke above the bridge; or elſe flew quite over the whole leaguer. As for the raiſing of a Battery right before the face of the point; that could not <hi>Tilly</hi> on the ſudden come to doe: for beſides that he was hindered by the wood; the fury of the Kings both ſmall and great ſhot, would at ſo neere a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance have ſpoild him as many men, as had adventured upon the ſervice: and the Kings Batteryes being firſt up, would not ſuffer <hi>Tilly</hi> to mount any of his Cannon right before him.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, there appeares to be more then a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane direction in it: ſeeing the King was made conſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the minds and judgements of his greateſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For when the day before, he asked the advice of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Generalls; and they, notwithſtanding they ſaw him ſo farre already engaged in the action, as he could not come off with his honor; had freely (all of them) profeſſed their utter diſlike of the deſigne: yet did the King plainely tell them, that he continued againſt all their reaſons, conſtant unto his owne purpoſe. Yea, there appeares not onely a more then humane <hi>direction,</hi> but a <hi>benediction</hi> alſo, in the eaſineſſe of the attaining of the paſſage: which very much exceeded all the Kings owne hopes of it. For when the day before he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Tilly</hi> to begin to worke againſt him; he apprehended ſo much danger in his owne deſigne, that ſhould he looſe but 2000 men in winning of his paſſage, he ſhould thinke (as he confeſſed) that he had made a thrifty purchaſe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Bavaria.</hi> When the next day (in like manner) that himſelfe being marcht over with the Horſe,<note place="margin">The Kings judgement of the difficulty and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the action.</note> had with his owne eyes perceived how ſufficiently <hi>Tilly</hi> was providing to entertaine him; he bleſt himſelfe for his good ſucceſſe in it: ſaying to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and divers of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders then about him; <hi>That this dayes action was neere of as great a conſequence, as that of Leipſich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo indeed it is worthy to be eſteemed by all ſouldiours. When Cardinall <hi>Paſman</hi> (the Emperours Ambaſſadour with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180870:84"/> the Pope) had the firſt newes brought him of this victory, and of the manner of it: hee to his friends pronounced <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt, There is an end of all:</hi> which ſome interpreted to be meant of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>Romiſh religion. Caiaphas</hi> (you know) did once prophecy. All this, as it gives us cauſe to admire Gods great providence, in creating ſuch a place as this crooking of the <hi>Lech,</hi> (and God ſurely had a purpoſe in it:) ſo it wonderfully likewiſe commends the Kings judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſo ſuddenly and ſo ſolidely apprehending the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it. And yet, for all this, had not the King eſcaped ſo cheape, as with the lives of two thouſand brave men; had not <hi>He</hi> that directed <hi>Davids ſling-ſtone</hi> into <hi>Goliahs</hi> forehead; gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one bullet unto <hi>Altringers</hi> forehead, and another into <hi>Tillyes</hi> thigh-bone: had not this brave old Count beene thus ſpoyled, the King had found but an unfriendly well-come into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> from that ſecond and greater <hi>Worke,</hi> which <hi>Tilly</hi> had laboured upon, from ſixe in the morning to eleven, but not yet finiſhed. That worke I meane, which is before mentioned in the wood. And yet would there have falne out another diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, which the King could never till then come to know of. Thus. Suppoſe he had peaceably paſſed the bridge; &amp; <hi>Tilly</hi> had let him doe it without diſturbance: yet would not the place, (hee being over) have ſuffered him to have charged the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians,</hi> with above two <hi>Brigades</hi> in front; and that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of advancing thorow the Woods, neceſſarily in diſorder too; neither of which two could poſſibly have beene avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: As for the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> they could have anſwered him from the Plaine, with ſixe <hi>Brigades</hi> in front; and by advantage of the plaine ground, all in order too. They might alſo have had the advantage of their already planted Batteryes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if that great one had beene perfected: when as the Kings on the other ſide of the River, muſt neceſſarily all this while have beene ſilent, or have ſhot into the enemy, thorow his owne people.</p>
            <p>And this is the Story of the Kings bridge over the <hi>Lech:</hi> the deſcription wherof we have thought worthy to be here in

            <p>The King at his comming before the towne, found 4500 ſouldiers in it: which by theſe degrees came up to this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

The reſt of the day, and the Munday following; the King labours about the laying of 2 bridges over the <hi>Lech:</hi> one above the Towne, and another below it. This ſame Munday, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſes ſome intercepted packets of letters to be opened; by which he underſtood the preſent conſtitution of the City: the double feare that the garriſon had; that is to ſay, of the

               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> within, (ſhould they recover their Armes) as well as of the enemy without the Citie.

The King exceeding loth to deface this faire Towne, which his care of it had rather receive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faire delivery, writes his Letters the ſame day unto them. The Contents were,<note place="margin">The Kings Letters to the Towne.</note> An admiration of His Majeſty at the Townes-mens behaviours in theſe Warres; that whereas they needed not to have meddled, yet had they ſundry times recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his enemies. For which, although hee had juſt cauſe to requite them, by deſtroying them and their Citie; yet giving way unto his naturall clemency, (which tended alwayes to preſerve all he could from their owne deſtruction) He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did now make proffer unto them of his Grace, if ſo be they did preſently diſcharge their garriſon, and declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for his Majeſty.</p>

And had His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie preuented that Imperiall command, and offered them a <hi>Swediſh</hi> garriſon firſt, they would neuer haue refuſed it. And whereas the licencing of their garriſon, was a thing aboue their power: they humbly beſought His Majeſtie to make them ſome gracious offer, and aduiſe them to depart q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Together with the Kings Letter, did <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> (now come backe unto the Kings army) ſend this word unto the Governor of the Towne,<note place="margin">

And therefore he thought him farre enough from ſo dangerous an ambition, as might induce him to hazard ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne a City of the Empire: whereby inſtead of preſerving it with reaſon, he ſhould loſe it rather and overthrow it,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180870:87"/> by a too late repentance, and a courſe unevitable. And if he truſted upon the numbers of the people, yet he could not be confident upon the ſtrength of his Fortifications: and as the valour of his men had as yet gained no renowne, ſo could he no wayes expect any ſuccours from the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> who upon the laſt defeate received neere <hi>Rain</hi> (where he loſt both his highlyeſt eſteemed Generalls <hi>Tilly</hi> and <hi>Altringer</hi>) had no greater care at that preſent, then to ſave his owne head. Therefore doe I (ſaith he) offer my ſelfe to intercede for you with the King my Maſter, to make a faire and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable accord with you: wherein, (were I but once aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Towne would be forthwith freed of her garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) I doubt not to prevaile with him.</p>
            <p>To the Townes-mens anſwer, the King thus replyed.<note place="margin">The Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their Letter.</note> That he was glad to heare they were not willing to hazard their flouriſhing eſtate; nor to make conjunction with his enemyes, or oppoſition againſt him: but yet did he once more adviſe them to diſcharge their garriſon, which hee knew well enough were no way able to withſtand ſo numerous a people as the Burgers were; much leſſe to fight againſt ſuch an Army, as himſelfe now had.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing the diſcharging of the garriſon was not in their power, and that they feared, the Governor would not out but upon faire termes; unleſſe which were granted, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe might runne to ſuch extremities, as might tend to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180870:88"/> deſtruction of ſo noble and flouriſhing a State. Therefore did they moſt humbly beſeech his Majeſty to conſider, that all the <hi>Protestants</hi> being now diſarmed, and diſabled thereby to aſſiſt the well inclined <hi>Catholikes,</hi> in any forcible attempt againſt the garriſon: he would let this be an argument unto him, to grant ſo gracious conditions unto the ſaid Governor, as might induce him to depart preſently. And ſo by the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Clemency of his Majeſty, ſhould their City be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the threatned ruine and deſolation.</p>
            <p>All this moved not the Governor nor his garriſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the King other arguments to perſwade them. All this time went his two bridges on, which were no ſooner finiſht, and the King ready to march over, and to bring his men to approach the walls; but they who had thundered all this time with their Ordnance, as if they intended to worke wonders; ſend out to the King to deſire a calme parlee, ere ever they came to ſhot of Musket.<note place="margin">The garriſon parlies, and yeelds.</note> Tis beſt treating (you may perceive) with a mans ſword in his hand: and to joyne an <hi>armed Orator</hi> in Commiſſion with a <hi>Gowned.</hi>

            <p>From thence, both their Majeſties, &amp;c. went to the great market place, called <hi>The Wine market:</hi> where there was a guard made of ſome ſouldiours, whileſt the Citizens tooke their Oath unto the King.

            </p>
            <p>The Contents were. 1. To remaine faithfull and loyall to his Majeſty, and the Crowne of <hi>Sweden.</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:180870:89"/> doth.

Hereabouts was the King met by an Ambaſſador from Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſecond brother unto the ruling Duke <hi>Maximilian.</hi> The Ambaſſador humbly preſents unto his Maieſty, that his ſaid Maſter Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> had alwaies hitherto behaved himſelfe as a quiet Prince, having never been a partaker in all theſe differences. For which reaſon his hope now was, (which favour he alſo craved) that his Maieſty would ſpare his poore Children, Subiects and Country; and not trouble them with any military charges or moleſtations. To all which the King replyed, That the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Brother had not beene ſpared, by the other party; notwithſtanding they had no wayes engaged themſelues in theſe warres: but on the contrary, all their eſtates had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all iuſtice and reaſon beene taken from them. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman perceiving the Kings reſolution by his anſwer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with it to his Maſter: who preſently packs up, and retires with his Lady and Children into the neighbour Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Saltzburg:</hi> whither the Ducheſſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> wife to the Duke now in action, was with-drawn beforehand. Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> is glad after this, to ſend another meſſenger unto the King, to compound for the rating of the contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Country.</p>
            <p>The next day, April 16. the King continues his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ingolſtat:</hi> with his whole Army both Horſe and Foot, now put into Battaglia; the Cannon marching upon their right hand. In this order he ſtill advances, till he comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of <hi>Ingolſtat:</hi> where by reaſon of a certaine Moraſſe, he is enforced to quit that forme of marching. Leading them therefore forward ſtill, (according as the place would ſuffer him) he comes within 2 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of the towne: where for that night in plaine <hi>Campagnia</hi> he encamped. The next day he advanc't further; paſſing in the way by 3 or 4 bridges, over ſome little brookes that runne that way into the <hi>Danuby.</hi> Paſſing on therefore beyond <hi>Stinne,</hi> till the Vantguard were
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180870:90"/> comne within musket-ſhot almoſt of the very walls of <hi>Ingol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat:</hi>

               </note> he cloſe by the gallowes bridge began to caſt up a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt</hi> and a <hi>Halfe-moone,</hi> upon that ſide of the bridge, namely, which is neereſt unto the Towne. The reaſon of the Kings approaching ſo neere the walls, was; becauſe of a hope he had upon ſome Correſpondents in the towne, by whoſe meanes he truſted to have it rendred. This day and the next, were ſpent in working: not at the Gallowes bridge onely, but in caſting up a <hi>regular Trench</hi> for the ſafeguard of the whole Army, which was now brought within Cannon ſhot of the Towne.</p>
            <p>This Towne of <hi>Ingolſtat</hi> (which hath an <hi>

Two bridges it now had over the <hi>Danuby;</hi> one within the towne, and another without it; which laſt is the ſame we called the Gallowes bridge, right before which, the King was encamped. This was guarded with 2 great <hi>Works,</hi> on the ſame ſide the King lay on.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was by this time marcht quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Ingolſtat:</hi>

            <p>They of the towne, ſhot very fiercely all this while with their great Ordnance, into the Kings Trenches: with which firſt and laſt, they kild him ſome three hundred ſouldiers. The firſt night after, (which was Thurſday, April 19.) ſome of the Towne iſſuing out,<note place="margin">A ſally</note> made a ſhow of themſelues by one of the Forts neere the Gallowes bridge.

            <p>On Friday morning, April 20, the King going out to give ſome directions to his Horſe-guards, that lay before one of the enemies bridges a little without the towne;<note place="margin">The Kings horſe ſhot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</note> had his Horſe ſhot under him with a Cannon bullet of 14 pound weight. The ſhot tooke him about the hinder skirt of the ſaddle; with the force of it turning both Horſe and King over and over. The King with this tumbling up and downe, having onely hurt his legge a little; was quickly gotten upon his feete againe. The firſt word he ſpake after it to the Squire of his body that then waited upon him, was, <hi>How could they poſſibly come to hit me? I thought I had beene in covert.</hi> Mounting forthwith upon his Squires horſe, he comes riding off unto his Quarter.

The Marqueſſes death, made the King more apprehenſive of his own danger and delivery: the meditation whereof, formed it ſelfe into this religious Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, publikely uttered by his Maieſty before divers of his chiefe Commanders in the Camp before <hi>Ingolſtat.</hi>

            <p>The late and unfortunate death of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> (whoſe fall I am moſt heartily ſorry for,<note place="margin">The Kings ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon his eſcape.</note> becauſe of thoſe rare vertues that were eminent in him, not unfit to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world) and that thundering Cannon ſhot withall,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:180870:91"/> doe put me in mind that I am but mortall, and ſubiect to the ſame miſchances, which the meaneſt of my ſubiects are liable unto. It is an univerſall decree, which neither my Crowne, my Birth, nor my Victories, are any wayes able to reskue or exempt me from. What therefore now remaineth, but that I wholly reſigne up my ſelfe unto the providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? who though he may pleaſe to call me out of this world, yet will he not for all that, abandon this ſo iuſt a cauſe, as I have now undertaken for the re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Germane</hi> liberties. He, doubtleſſe, will raiſe up ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more wiſe, more couragious and valiant then my ſelfe; who ſhall put a period unto this warre. I know that the good ſucceſſe which it hath pleaſed God to affoord me in my enterpriſes, hath made ſome to enuy me: who alſo labour to perſwade the ſimple, that I endeavour nothing more then mine owne profit; by the robbing and ſpoyling of others. But I in this caſe call all thoſe Princes to witneſſe, whom I have againe re-eſtabliſhed into their own rights and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances: and thoſe Creditors alſo, of whom I have borrowed ſuch hugy ſummes of money, as at <hi>Franckford</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: yea and the dangers too, which I daily expoſe my Perſon unto; whether or no I have left mine own kingdome, and thoſe that are <hi>Deareſt</hi> to me in this world, for any other end, or with any other intention, but onely to pull downe the tyranny of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to obtaine a ſolid and a ſettled peace unto all men.</p>
            <p>This Oration of the Kings was here interrupted, by the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acclamations of the Auditory, and the cheerefull promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their beſt aſſiſtances: all of them with teares beſeeching his Maieſty, to be more carefull in time to come of adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Royall Perſon; and to continue his firſt reſolutions: as they for their parts there vowed, to perſiſt in their fidelities.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday, April 22. had the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador his Audience of the King. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Monſieur de S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Eſtienne,</hi> reſident with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was come

Twas a brave Palfrey indeed; but (me thinkes) they might have had a better project with his hyde, then ſtuft it: had they but made a Drumme of it, the ſound of that, would (no doubt) have driven away all the horſes of their enemies. But now they have ſtuft the skinne, what will they doe with the bones? They ſhould doe well to uſe them as the <hi>Turkes</hi> did <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> bones at <hi>Lyſſa:</hi> which they digd up, and ſet in Rings and Iewels.

But their ſpight choſe rather to uſe this horſe, as thoſe of <hi>Breda</hi> did the <hi>Boate,</hi> by which their Towne had beene taken: they whipt the boate up and downe the ſtreets, and then hangd it up for a <hi>Trophee.</hi> But we have enough (too much will ſome ſay) made our ſelves merry with the <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> who before the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> comming into <hi>Germany,</hi> laught in their ſleeves at all the world beſides.</p>
            <p>The next day (which was Wedneſday, Aprill 25) the King marches from <hi>Geiſenfelt</hi> to <hi>Mosburg</hi> upon the River <hi>Iſer;</hi>

               </note> a very dainty little Towne upon the River <hi>Iſer</hi> (though the glory of it be chiefely in two Streets) ſome eight <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the North-Eaſt of <hi>Mosburg.</hi> At the firſt comming of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> forces before the walls, one of their Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of a troope of Horſe, with ſome few others of his Cornet, were ſhot from an Ambuſh in the gardens. That mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, had ſome 1300 <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſe (after a very hard march of nine <hi>Dutch</hi> miles together) put themſelves into the Towne: ſo that they ſeemed yet to be reſolute upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. But ſo ſoone as ever they perceived the groſſe of the 5000 Foote, to be come up, they retreated out of the Towne unto the further ſide of the River <hi>Iſer;</hi> breaking the bridges downe behind them. The Towne paid 100000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to the King for its ranſome; and gave <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> 20000 beſides, for a gratuity. <hi>Landſhut</hi> being thus taken, and Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> (for the time) left Governour, <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> went backe againe to the King; who two dayes after the taking,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Land ſperg</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> comes and lodges in it. The day before this, was the handſome Towne of <hi>Landſperg</hi> upon the River <hi>Lech,</hi> taken by Colonell <hi>Slammerſdorff</hi> with 300 Dragooners: ſent (as I collect) from the Governour of <hi>Ausburg.</hi> After <hi>Landſperg,</hi> were the two good Townes of <hi>Fueſſen</hi> and <hi>Schonga;</hi> both more Southerly and higher up the <hi>Lech</hi> taken alſo. In <hi>Landſhut,</hi> the King ſtaid ſome five or ſixe dayes. Some of the reaſon for which (beſides the refreſhing of the Army) may be a thought the King had towards <hi>Ratisbone</hi> or <hi>Regens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg:</hi> whence (as tis written) divers had ſent to ſollicite him to come thither. And indeed the whole Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Landſhut</hi> and <hi>Regenſpurg,</hi> for foure <hi>Bavarian</hi> Leagues together, was all the way open.

And yet out of a hope to ſee himſelfe once againe Maſter of this Palace, had he beene ſo carefull to preſerve it, that he had ſent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand unto his Chancellor to deliver it over, when-ever the King ſhould make towards it. The Deputies of the Towne likewiſe, had beene at <hi>Freifing</hi> with the King, May 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and had made tender of 200000 Dollars for theyr ranſome: which would not be accepted.

The chiefe condition which they requeſted was, that their garriſon might march out without diſturbance: which was indeed in the Kings power to have hindered, his Horſe lying every where up and downe in the Country.

            <p>The next day, the King went to ſee the Magazine and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; where great ſtore of armes and ammunition were found, but no Ordnance: at which the King not a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; eſpied by and by divers of the carriages; by which he gueſſed, as the truth was, that the peeces were buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ground. Theſe <hi>dead ones</hi> (as he cald them) he cauſed the Boores with ropes and leavers, to raiſe up without a miracle. There were 140 faire Peeces of braſſe Ordnance; and in one, 30000 pieces of gold, ſaid to be found. Among the reſt, were 12 eminent ones; by the Duke called the 12 <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> though ſurely the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were never ſuch <hi>ſonnes of Thunder.</hi> Some peeces had the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> Armes upon them; which cauſed the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> both to ſigh and ſmile, at the ſight of them. But the <hi>Kunſt-Cammer,</hi> or <hi>Chamber of Rarities,</hi> was the thing that affoorded moſt entertainment: where the beholders admired rather, then lookt upon, the incomparable varieties

The King went into this Church, iuſt when the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were at their <hi>Maſſe:</hi> and the Father <hi>Rector</hi> comming towards the King, his Majeſty entertained a diſcourſe in <hi>Latine</hi> with him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> The King after this, calling the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens together; askes them whether they would hereafter fight againſt him, or pay the Contribution from time to time, that ſhould be impoſed upon them?

One of the firſt townes he began withall, was <hi>Kurchberg</hi> upon the river <hi>Iler;</hi> ſome 4 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the South of <hi>Vlm.</hi> This towne having the honour of an Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the King (as I find writing for it) beſtowed upon the Conquerour. But of this I can ſay no more. At what time the King lay betwixt <hi>Donawert</hi> and the <hi>Lech,</hi> (which is about 48 or 50 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Vlm:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His action.</note>) Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> advances up the ſame river <hi>Iler</hi> beyond <hi>Memmingen,</hi> unto <hi>Kempten,</hi> (neere the river <hi>Lech</hi>) where there is an <hi>Abby:</hi> the firſt in order of all theſe of the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Schwaben. Guntzperg,</hi> a faire towne upon the River <hi>Guntz,</hi> betwixt <hi>Vlm</hi> and <hi>Lawingen,</hi> is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likewiſe taken. From this towne, a little after this, are 8 troopes of Dragooners ſent from the Kings army over the bridge at <hi>Lawingen;</hi> to rufflle the Cloyſters in the neighbour Marquiſate of <hi>Burgaw;</hi> to bring them under contribution; and to lye in waite for 500 Horſe of <hi>Oſſaes,</hi> that were to come from <hi>Lindaw.</hi> At this <hi>Guntzperg</hi> is there a faire Palace, of right belonging unto the Marqueſſes of <hi>Burgaw:</hi> though at this time the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> had invaded it. The lands of the Lords <hi>Fuggers,</hi> are now alſo brought under contribution. <hi>Erpach</hi> is likewiſe over-runne, belonging unto the Chancellor <hi>Von Vlm.</hi> The 500 <hi>Tillians</hi> who had beene left at <hi>Nordlingen,</hi> about 30 miles to the North-Eaſt of <hi>Vlm,</hi> preſently forſake the Towne: upon the newes, namely, of the Kings paſſing of the <hi>Lech.</hi> In the beginning of April, Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthven</hi> puts ſome of his ſouldiers into <hi>Memmingen:</hi> out of which, he a little after that expels the <hi>Ieſuites:</hi> whom he found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotting with the Imperialiſts. About <hi>Leutkirken,</hi> others of his defeate ſome of <hi>Oſſaes</hi> guards. <hi>Ravenſperg</hi> and <hi>Bibrach,</hi> 2 other Imperiall Cities, declare for the King: and divers Lords and Gentlemen, daily ſend their Deputies unto our Governour of <hi>Vlm,</hi> to compound for their contributions. This if they did not, their lands were plundered. He a little after this, diſarmes the Citizens of <hi>Elching</hi> and <hi>Weiſſenhorn,</hi> (both neere <hi>Vlm:</hi>) and takes 14 pecces of Cannon and 2
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:180870:99"/> Murtherers, away from them. Preſently after which, he ſends, and defeates <hi>Schwendy</hi> (or <hi>Schweaden</hi>) and his Boores, (which, he being a Gentleman of the Country, had ſtirr'd up) and takes himſelfe priſoner. Having thus advanced ſo farre to the Southward, the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is glad to ſend to him to make his agreement. And thus is all the Country, for the while, cleered; even to the gates of <hi>Lindaw</hi> and the <hi>Bodenſee,</hi> under the very <hi>Alps:</hi> which ſo continues, untill <hi>Oſſa</hi> (now gone thence to the <hi>Switzers Diet</hi> of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> to procure paſſage for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> over the <hi>Gotthart Alps</hi>) returnes about the beginning of May with his 7000 men, and beſieges <hi>Bibrach,</hi> as we before told you.</p>
            <p>Whether Colonell <hi>Sperreuter,</hi> who tooke <hi>Dunkelſpach</hi> and <hi>Elwang,</hi> on the Northſide of the <hi>Danuby,</hi> were ſent by him, or immediately from the King; I know not. After <hi>Slammerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff</hi> had taken <hi>Landſperg:</hi> the towne of <hi>Mindelhaim,</hi> upon the river <hi>Mindel,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Lech</hi> and the <hi>Danuby,</hi> almoſt right againſt <hi>Landſperg,</hi> made alſo her compoſition. And thus (to be briefe) did all thoſe good Townes, which you ſhall find in the Map of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> in the South-Eaſt corner: moſt of which Country is called <hi>Overland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the laſt Munday in April, Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthven</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feates ſome Imperiall troopes, and takes 4 Enſignes from them. The Boores alſo riſing the ſecond time, againe incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Boores comming amongſt them, <hi>Schwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> ſecond provocation,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Mapps</hi> of the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Suevia,</hi> or of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> for theſe townes.</note> (let looſe upon his ranſome) and the heartning on of <hi>Oſſa</hi> and <hi>Harincourt;</hi> are againe defeated. A many of theſe Boores, firſt riſe about <hi>Gensburg</hi> and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: who ſending word to the reſt, appoint their meeting place about <hi>Weingarten,</hi> ſome 30 miles to the South of <hi>Vlm.</hi> Theſe in the beginning of May, comming up; ſurpriſe <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> an Imperiall towne, <hi>Ravenſperg</hi> and others, betwixt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm</hi> and <hi>Lindaw.</hi> Againſt them, Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> ſends 3000 men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them Dragooners: who May 12 killing ſome of them neere unto <hi>Kempten,</hi> (25 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles Eaſt of <hi>Wangen</hi>) make the reſt ſweare to goe home and follow their clodding againe,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:180870:99"/> and pay their contributions quietly. Others of them being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie otherwhere, 400 more are ſlaine about this Biſhopricke of <hi>Kempten:</hi> which their neighbours perceiuing, goe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their Armes at <hi>Kempten.</hi> At <hi>Zippersriden,</hi> are almoſt 800 more cut in pieces, and (which was the way to coole them) are divers of their Dorps fired: which the poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſeeing, went and cut their Land-lords throates, that had firſt ſtirr'd them up, and then forſaken them. Colonell <hi>Rhelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> (who had done many other good ſervices in theſe parts) affrights and diſarmes 300 more of them, with a ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Horſemen. <hi>Rhelinger</hi> proceedes ſo farre, that <hi>Oſſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of his falling into <hi>Tirole,</hi> is faine to ſend 2000 men thither, to enſure the paſſages. About the end of April, Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthven</hi> goes into the Duchy of <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> where he receives an aide of 2000 new men, from Duke <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>Adminiſtrator.</hi> In his abſence, the Lord <hi>Druches</hi> of <hi>Wald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> with other Gentlemen and ſome Abbots; began to ſtirre againe, in the further parts towards <hi>Weingarten:</hi> who did much trouble unto the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſouldiers in the townes next to them. To repreſſe them, went the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Dragooners that lay in and about <hi>Bibrach:</hi> who fell in among the lands of the ſaid Lord <hi>Druches</hi> plundered the Townes of <hi>Wurtbach</hi> and <hi>Waldſee,</hi> neere unto <hi>Weingarten,</hi> and diſperſed the Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The good Towne of <hi>Ehingen</hi> alſo, on the contrary ſide of the <hi>Danuby,</hi> to <hi>Vlm,</hi> and within 6 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of it, is brought likewiſe to a Compoſition:<note place="margin">That part of <hi>Schwabland,</hi> brought by Sir <hi>Patrick Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. under Contribution.</note> as all this part of <hi>Schwab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by this time was. At this towne of <hi>Ehingen,</hi> whileſt <hi>Lodowick Eberhard</hi> Count of <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> with one of the Kings Secretaries and ſome other Commiſſioners were, (having beene thither employed about taking the Citizens oath for the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) they were all ſurpriſed and carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners into <hi>Tirole,</hi> by a Partee ſent out from <hi>Oſſa,</hi> at the time of his being about <hi>Bibrach.</hi> To be a ranſome for whoſe liberties, the King cauſes ſome great men of the Country to be laid hands of. The Imperialiſts that did this at <hi>Ehingen,</hi> and ſtaid there; fell out and troubled the Countrey now and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180870:100"/> then: and upon the firſt of Iune following, when the King was gone towards <hi>Norimberg;</hi> they drove away divers head of Cattel even from within 2 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of <hi>Vlm:</hi> there being at that time no Horſemen in the towne to make out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. But theſe are ſince ſent packing. Thus is all that country the Kings, by conqueſt: and for the keeping of it quiet, were the Armies of Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Patricke Ruthven,</hi> left thereabouts: the Duke of <hi>Wirtembergs</hi> forces being at hand too; who is their very next neighbour upon the other ſide of the <hi>Danuby.</hi> And in this eſtate the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> left this Country, in the beginning of Iune; when he tooke his leave of it, and of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> whom when we have waited upon from <hi>Donawert</hi> to <hi>Norimberg;</hi> we will for this time conclude our Story of him.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR as much as among the multitude of falſe rumours, that are promiſcuouſly divulged, aſwell within, as without the bounds and territories of the Empire; concerning thoſe affaires that are now preſented upon the ſtage of action, in this ſcene of Warre: thoſe that ring low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, (though with leaſt ſemblance of truth or credibility) are ſuch as deepely trench upon the candor and ſincerity of my intention. The which ſeeme not ſo much to have beene firſt broached, by the inventers of fayned novelties; and ſuch light ſpirits, as are enamoured with falſe curioſities: as to have beene ſet on foote, by the capitall enemies of my renowne and reputation. Such as have fixed the eye of their intention, upon a higher (though more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and malicious deſigne) then to amuſe the world, with the relation of unprofitable fables. In regard whereof I was forced to beleeve, That I could not neglect theſe injurious calumnies, without doing deepe wrong unto mine honour: and that I ſtand obliged, to avow and give a manifeſt <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to all the world, of the certitude and ſincerity of my moſt private intentions. Which therefore I now reſolve to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180870:101"/> doe, by this publike Act and open Proteſtation: even as from the beginning of this warre I have endevoured to have done, by the cleare teſtimony of my publike and undoubted actions; a great deale more effectually, then I poſſibly can doe by waight of words, or by any tenor of verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations.</p>
            <p>Now then, having firſt invoked and called downe upon mee, the direfull wrath and juſt vengeance, both of God and man; if in this ſerious buſineſſe, I either faine or diſſemble: I doe proteſt, that the moſt powerfull and ſoveraigne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that have beene the cheife conductors of all my actions (aſwell in the times of peace, as in this of warre) have beene from their firſt origin and beginning, and at this preſent are, and by Gods gracious aſſiſtance hereafter ever ſhalbe; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the zeale and fidelity, which I owe and have ſolemnely ſworne to his ſacred Imperiall Majeſty, and the reeſtabliſhing of the Catholike, Apoſtolike, Roman Faith in the territories of this Empire; from many faire parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it hath beene treacherouſly exiled; with no leſſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacriledge, then cruell tyranny. So that in this, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes have not aimed at any other end, then the glory of God, and the diſcharge of my owne conſcience.</p>
            <p>I put on armes, at the firſt commotion of the treacherous revolt in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and have not yet laid them downe, in the preſervation and defence of ſo noble and juſt a cauſe. And how I have comported my ſelfe in them, I need not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for all Chriſtendome will beare record with me, that with juſt cauſe, this age hath given already, and all ſucceeding ages ſhall give hereafter; immortall thankes to the God of armies, for the glorious atchievements with which he hath bleſſed us. A part of which memorable exploits, his divine goodneſſe hath beene pleaſed to execute by my weake hands; and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Imperiall Majeſty hath received ſuch ſatisfaction in my indeavours, that he hath beene pleaſed to affoord me a large occaſion to receive much greater from him, in the heape of maſſy honours; wherewith he hath vouchſafed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:180870:102"/> the weake ſervices I have done to the ſtate of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and that of Gods Church; the advancement of both which, are linked and chayned together, in the inviolable bond of one common intereſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I verily beleeve, that no reaſonable man (that doth not ſuffer himſelfe to be wilfully coozened with malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conjecture, and groundleſſe divination) can frame his judgement to conceive, that I would now change my firſt reſolutions, and alter my deſignes: at ſuch a time eſpecially, as when I have ſo important a Subject, and binding obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to renew and reenforce them more then I could foreſee, or imagine at their firſt undertaking. For if that be true, which now paſſeth for currant in a great part of the World: that the prime and chiefeſt ayme in this new combination and conſpiracy, is to reinveſt my Coſin Count <hi>Frederick</hi> in the dignity of his Electorſhip, and eſtate of his territories; from which he hath beene moſt juſtly throwne and dejected, for hauing falſified his oath and loyalty to his Imperiall Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, by the religious bond of a ſacred oath not long before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him; and rebelliouſly ſought to diſpoſſeſſe him of his Crowne and dominion: I ſay, if this be the true cauſe of theſe bloudy commotions (as they would make the world beleeve it is) then I am the man, againſt whom they ſhould have diſcharged the gall of their intemperate fury. And therefore to imagine, that I would joyne in league and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt them, that have no cauſe to take armes, but in defence of my right: is to preſume againſt the nature of things, and to frame a <hi>dictamen,</hi> contrary to the principles even of common ſenſe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And if there be nothing but this to rectifie, what concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it my Lord the Emperour, and the whole noble family of Auſtria; that I ſhould rather enjoy the dignity of an Elector, then my foreſaid Coſin; or that I ſhould poſſeſſe a part of that eſtate, of which he hath beene ſo juſtly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Or to what end ſhould they endeavour to prejudice the pretended reſtitution of them both, if I were pleaſed to yeeld
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:180870:102"/> my conſent thereunto? Verily it would ſeeme a pleaſant and ſportfull warre, that ſhould be undertaken to force me to be more rich and powerfull, then I my ſelfe deſired.</p>
            <p>But men may ſay (peradventure) that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> alſo poſſeſſeth a good part of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> which I grant he doth: but this is ſo farre from ingaging me to relinquiſh any part of my juſt claime, that it is rather a powerfull rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more firmely to oblige me, to uphold and maintaine mine owne claime and juſt tytle; ſeeing him borne downe with the concurrence of ſo puiſſant<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> King.</note> a Monarch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if wee reſt in the principles of reaſon and humane prudence, it can neither have likelyhood, apparance, nor colour of truth; that I ſhould now be changed and become another man, then heretofore I have beene.</p>
            <p>And if any man have fancied ſo prodigious a change and alteration in me, for that they have knowne me leſſe pleaſed with ſome deſignes &amp; proceedings of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, in ſome caſes, wherin the cauſe of <hi>Religion</hi> was no way <hi>intereſſed;</hi> he might from thence have groundedly collected, that in caſe the Cauſe debated, were onely concerning the raiſing of their particular greatneſſe, and extent of their fortunes; there yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in my breſt, ſufficient ſparkes of freedome and generous worth, to have oppoſed their wills, and contradicted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments (I not judging them juſtifiable, rather then have made this ſtrained and ridiculous inference upon it, that I fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a reſolution to band it with the route of their enemyes: they eſpecially, being ſuch, as with all the ſtreame of their ſtrongeſt endeavours, make profeſſion to purſue and perſecute the faith I profeſſe.

But that which toucheth my heart with higheſt ſtraines of juſt feare, and that whereof great and good Princes (in my opinion) ought to be moſt ſenſible, and (if I might be beleeved) is, that that illuſtrious Family (as ancient

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:180870:108"/> himſelfe in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> name being Interponent, would take any paines about making up the breaches.</p>

That he could by no meanes conceive a reaſon, how things in this deſperate condition of the whole Empire in generall, could any wayes be bettered, by theſe perſonall and particular trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes. That during the time of theſe troubles, it had by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of examples beene manifeſted; that no generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord could by theſe private Leaguings be procured: but that more dangerous conſequences dayly brake foorth upon it.

            <p>For the Lord <hi>Albert Walenſtein</hi> Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> was the man, that had the voyces of the Courtiers for it: ſuch Councellors eſpecially, as being lovers of his vaſt bounties; knew by experience, that if <hi>Fridland</hi> chanc't upon a good <hi>Mayn,</hi> ſtrucke a lucky hand of it, he would pay the boxe well for it. <hi>Walenſtein</hi> (they knew) was no ſuch ſlight Captaine, as thoſe that had ſcarce heard of him, ſuppoſed.

            </p>
            <p>His old friend <hi>Queſtenberg</hi> could not (it ſeemes) prevaile with him at the firſt; it was the month of December ere <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſtein</hi> would accept it: and then (as himſelfe profeſſed) at the perſwaſions of Prince <hi>Eggenberg.</hi> And herein (me thinkes) appeares a ſtrange mixture of ſpirit, in this <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed as haughty and ambitious of Command, as any man in the world; yet was he ſo farre foorth maſter of the greatneſſe of his owne deſires; as that he could with as much moderation now refuſe the Generallſhip, as he had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignd it: he would not have authority, but with <hi>freedome,</hi> and his owne <hi>Conditions.</hi> Others have cenſured this for <hi>Pride</hi> in him: though nothing (me thinkes) lookes liker <hi>Honour.

            <p>The Imperiall Commiſſion being ſent him unto <hi>Znaim</hi> in <hi>Moravia;</hi> he there began to hang out his Enſignes, to beate up his Drums, and to give out his Patents for a levy. Not yet as Generall; for King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (for the more credit to the action) ſtill kept the Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> to himſelfe. To lay the ground-worke for the new Army, was <hi>Diepenbach</hi> (either voluntarily or by command) brought to reſigne up his <hi>Sileſian</hi> troopes unto <hi>Walenſtein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The levyes went on; and the intention was knowne to be for the recovery of <hi>Bohemia;</hi>

But for ſuch a worke, all things went not on, as he deſired: he would come into the field like himſelfe, or not at all. The moneyes already raiſed, were too ſmall a ſumme for him: and he would have his men in the beſt manner accommodated. He demands three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gold, for the raiſing of 70000 men: propounds to have 5 000 Curiaſſiers or men at armes, raiſed in the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> and that Baron <hi>Dhona</hi> ſhould bring him 10000 <hi>Coſacks:</hi> He deſires Quarter for twelve Regiments in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia;</hi>

            <p>If any thing may ſeeme to make theſe Articles leſſe credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is that a many will hardly be brought to ſuſpect, that the Emperour ſhould ever condiſcend to the creating of ſuch a <hi>military Dictator;</hi> for ſo he is upon the point.
